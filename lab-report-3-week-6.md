>2. Then create we need to run some linux command and since I'm on windows I needed to install wsl. I then do *wsl* in order to be able to run linux commands.
>3. Then I had to create a file call "config" so we needed to do *touch config* which creates the config file.
>4. Then I had to do *nano config* which allows me to edit the config file and I then copied the command from the wirteup and pasted it onto the config file.
>5. Finally I tried logging in by doing ssh ieng6 and it worked!
